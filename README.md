dynQBF 
====================

dynQBF is an expansion-based QBF solver for instances in prenex CNF form.  First, 
the CNF matix is split into subproblems by constructing a tree decomposition. 
The QBF is then solved by dynamic programming over the tree decomposition. While 
the structure of the CNF is reflected by the tree decomposition, structure within 
the prefix is considered by integrating dependency schemes in the solving process.
Furthermore, dynQBF uses nested sets of binary decision diagrams  (BDDs) to 
efficiently store intermediate results.

The core concepts of dynQBF are described in [1] and [2]. The solver relies on 
htd (https://github.com/mabseher/htd) for constructing the tree decomposition 
and CUDD (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/) for handling the BDDs. Optionally, 
DepQBF (https://github.com/lonsing/depqbf) can be used to compute the standard 
dependency scheme.

Building dynQBF 
---------------

For instructions about compiling, please read the INSTALL file.

Precompiled binaries are available at https://github.com/gcharwat/dynqbf/releases

Running dynQBF
--------------

A simple program call is of the following form:

    ./dynqbf -f $file

Run `./dynqbf -h` to get a complete list of all available options.
In order to obtain reproducible results, you might want to fix the seed by using option `--seed <s>`.
